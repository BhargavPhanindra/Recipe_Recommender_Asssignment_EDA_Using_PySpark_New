# Recipe_Recommender_Asssignment_EDA

## Objective of this Case Study

As an ML engineer at food.com, our task is to design a recommender system that suggests recipes to users based on their choices and the recipe they are currently viewing. A successful recommender system can increase user engagement and lead to more business opportunities. The performance of the recommendation engine will directly impact the revenue generated by the website. However, building a recommender from scratch is time-consuming. In this assignment, you will explore data and create features to build the recommender.
